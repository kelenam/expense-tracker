# Expense Tracker 
Simple expense tracker app, uses higher-order array methods to filter/map/reduce values and totals. 

## Instructions/How-to-Play
- Simply start guessing letters by typing them into your keyboard
- Win state: Guessing the word within 5 guess
- Lose State: Six wrong letter guesses.
- Cheat: the generated word is stored as a global variable. If you console log that variable by name you will have the answer.

## How to Install
- `git clone` this repo
- No hard dependencies required to run so no need for `npm/yarn` installs. 
- Just open the `index.html` file or use server of your choice.
- Note: If modifying the file, and you have TS already installed, you can just call `tsc --watch` in the root project directory to compile your js into appropriate dir.
- I'd recommend using the VSCode Sass Plugin as well.  
 
## Project Notes
It might just be easier to reference this: https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/ for your css/html Emmet shortcuts. Super handy reference and heavily reduces the amount of time necessary for writing out styles.
